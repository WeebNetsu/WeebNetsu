### Welcome! ðŸŒ±

My name is Stephen, but most will know me by my username Netsu. I am a full stack web developer.

I'm currently learning ReactNative and Django, my favorite programming language is Python and I use Manjaro Linux as my primary OS.

I have a YouTube channel called [Steve's teacher](https://www.youtube.com/stevesteacher) where I teach other how to code and make occasional how-to and comedy videos.
